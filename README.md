### Description
This code only works woth Dashticz, a dashboard solution for [Domoticz](https://github.com/domoticz/domoticz). Dashticz is created and maintained by @lokonli and can be found here https://github.com/Dashticz/dashticz.

This repro is a collection of Dashticz components I have created for my own use and I provide them as is without any guaranties for maintance. Perhaps you can find something useful.

I decided to create them mainly because I wanted to learn more Javascript and to add new features to my Dashticz dashboard.
